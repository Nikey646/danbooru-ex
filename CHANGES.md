# Release 1301

* Greatly improved performance and reduced flickering.

* Add preview panel. Switch to Preview mode using the Mode menu or by pressing ~ (tilde).
  In preview mode clicking thumbnails will open the full image in a preview panel.

* Redesigned tag script mode: Clicking thumbnails selects the post and opens a
  preview instead of applying tags immediately. After your posts are selected,
  click Apply or press Shift+A to apply tags. This helps you avoid misclicks and
  lets you see the full image as you work.

* Make the tag sidebar resizeable: collapse it to gain space, or expand it so
  those annoying long tags are more readable.

* Make the search bar closeable so it doesn't follow you as you scroll (I like
  it but I'm sure some of you hate that).

* Add configuration options. Edit the variables at the top of the script to
  disable tweaks you don't want.

* Underline bad wiki links (links to empty or nonexistent tags).

* Press Ctrl+enter in search bar to open search in a new tab.

# Fixes

* Fix broken autocomplete in search bar.
* Fix mode menu brokeness.
* Fix header layout brokenness at smaller screen widths (should work up to ~960px).
