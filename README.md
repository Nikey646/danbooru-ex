# Main features

* Search bar and mode menu available on every page.

* [Thumbnail previews](https://gfycat.com/VelvetyWeakKangaroo): hover over any thumbnail or post #1234 link to popup a large image preview.

* [Preview panel](https://gfycat.com/FamousPastItalianbrownbear): Select Preview from the Mode menu then click a thumbnail. A panel will appear showing you the full post without leaving the page.

* [Redesigned tag script mode](https://gfycat.com/AnyNewIrukandjijellyfish): Clicking thumbnails selects the post and opens a preview instead of applying tags immediately. After your posts are selected, click Apply or press Shift+A to apply tags. This helps you avoid mistagging posts, lets you select posts in bulk, and lets you see the full image as you work.

* [Resizeable tag sidebar](https://fat.gfycat.com/ShadowySecondaryIslandcanary.webm): collapse it to get more space, or expand it to read long tags that normally wrap around the tag list.

* [Colorized tags in the wiki and in the forum](https://i.imgur.com/6KtblP7.png).

* [Visible comment scores and extra post info](https://i.imgur.com/nAMMxFe.png).
