   without thumnbnails.
** If you're in tag script mode on /posts, and you open a thumbnail in a new
   tab, you will still be in tag script mode. This is annoying.

** Investigate Facebook React for fully rendering stuff clientside instead of
   trying to reshape existing HTML with jquery like a caveman.
** Use babel to transpile from ES6.
** The CSS styles should be external.
